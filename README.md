# Assignment 2 for Cloud Technologies at NTNU Gj√∏vik
## Task Description
For this assignment, you will develop an API that aggregates information from our Gitlab deployment i.e., https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no. Please ensure you use our deployment, not gitlab.com, since you will most certainly trigger their rate limit.
This includes two parts,

- the development of an API for direct invocation, as well as an
- interface for the registration of Webhooks for invocation upon certain events.

The developed services will be dockerised and deployed on OpenStack (we will talk about both those in upcoming sessions). For persistence, use a NoSQL storage option of your choice.
